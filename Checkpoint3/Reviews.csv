"(at the end I have updated to my latest experience) So I ordered it coz it has too many features and also a trust on this brand, but I am still using in the early phase so I'll share my pov:PROS:-Used around 3 days it came full charge and still has 80% battery (listening high quality music at 50-70% and gaming on gaming mode (will talk about gaming too wait!) so it will last around more than 7-8 days easily :) at 60% but haven't tested it completely will update soon :)-plastic and durability is like 3.8 or 4 out of 5 they used hard plastic so that's good also the comfort is good it has soft cushions and also appearance of the headphone is really really good go for black or biege option!- Sound quality is like 8/10 it has really good base! The vocals are clear if you increase your volume to 50% + but it does have a con will share in a moment- if you are under 20 age with small to medium head then it is suitable for you :)- yes the SD card works very well just make sure your SD card is clean and only has .mp3 files.-Gamers you can go for it if you don't play sports! Then go for it, Emin gaming mode it has very minimal latency which unfortunately I can't count but yeah I play a lot of games so it is working very well, you can play in 80% volume no leakage :) depends on the game also! The aux cable and gaming mode both works equally same and is really good :)- Voice call quality is 8/10 :)CONS:-if you have bigger head don't buy it, it will fit your head easily but then the cushions will start hurting in 3-4 hours so yeah like I have medium to bigger head so it hurts a bit after some hours-Cushions doesn't absorb any sweat!- it has sound leakage issue so basically above 60% or above 50% the sound comes out! Well it depends on what you are listening if it's phonk then stay low at 40-50% trust me it still sounds good! If you are listening to simple lofi songs then go for 60% + so yeah!- the ENC is a joke here üòÇ- in gaming the sounds of gunshots are a bit too loud so yeahSo yeah a 4 day review and yes it is worth it and value for money product also a year warranty is also there haha!Will update after some weeks of usage :)Edit : so after months of usage it's still like when I bought ‚ù§Ô∏è perfect durable looks are still good also the sound quality at this price range is perfect also every method works and connectivity is fast, for me using everyday 3-6 hrs works easily for 10 days! You don't even need to turn on gaming mode coz the normal mode is just so good! Barely any latency, the enc is clickbait I don't think it works but honestly for me when I wear it and play music or meeting calls and other multimedia at at least 50-60 volume : I can't hear noise at all barely audible so that's good! Overall gor for it!Read more",4.0,,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2024

"I am using this from 2.5 years these headphones are in a good condition till now , I am not facing any issue with the functioning and sound quality of itBut I reduced 2 stars because the build quality is not good as you can see in the picture and I have faced some connectivity issues sometimes and the battery life had reduced,both sides are working properly and I will not recommend this headphones for gaming there are many good options instead of this but if your priority is not gaming you should go for it and it is comfortable to useRead more",3.0,,Reviewed in India on 24 November 2024
"For 600‚Çπ it offers quite a lot of features. The most striking aspect is it's battery, I am like a daily user and yet once fully charged, these headphones can carry the music upto 3 days. The connectivity is great it almost gets connected in milliseconds. Fit is okayish but the build quality kinda disappoints sometimes. Gaming mode and stuff is cool considering it basically stops any delay. The 3.5mm wire is another let down, sometimes it stops playing music on one side when using the wire.Overall a pretty solid purchase for the price. If you would want better ones then you gotta put in 500-600‚Çπ more so I guess this one's worth the price.Read more",4.0,,Reviewed in India on 11 January 2025
It good but sound quality can be better but good product it durabilityRead more,3.0,,Reviewed in India on 24 January 2025
"This product is comfortable to wear and sound quality is reasonable within the price range but if you are someone who likes to enjoy music in privacy then it might not be for you. There is sound leakge even at normal volume and noise cancellation is none. But if you are someone who hears music at 50% volume or less then its good for you.Plus new replacement policy is cumbersome, if any defect is experienced by the customer, he is required to visit service center. Nobody has the time to first deal with defect then go lenghts to first replace it then return it if problem persists.Read more",2.0,,Reviewed in India on 7 February 2025
"Rating: 4/5Pros:* Budget-friendly* Decent build quality* Type-C charging* ENC and gaming modes* Long battery life (up to 5 days)* Unexpectedly good sound qualityCons:* Average comfort for extended wear* Lack of rotate and fold featuresOverall:The Zebronics Zeb Thunder Pro offers a solid value proposition for budget-conscious consumers. Its impressive battery life, convenient Type-C charging, and useful features like ENC and gaming mode make it a compelling choice. While the comfort level might not be ideal for long-term wear and the absence of rotate and fold features could be a drawback for some, the overall package justifies its price point. If you're looking for an affordable pair of earbuds with decent performance and a range of features, including unexpectedly good sound quality, the Zebronics Zeb Thunder Pro is definitely worth considering.Read more",4.0,,Reviewed in India on 18 October 2024
"Good bass, near zero noise and great sound for its price. The addition of an SD Card reader and FM makes it a complete on the go music package that you can use without having your phone around. I do wish it had the memory inbuilt instead of having to insert an SD card along with a type C charging / data transfer port instead of a micro SD. Else it's a great device for the price.Read more",5.0,,Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 3 September 2023
